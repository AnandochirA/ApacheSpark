Project Overview
This project implements a high-performance data pipeline using Apache Spark for processing and transforming large datasets, specifically focusing on over 4 million Yelp records. The project leverages Apache Spark's distributed computing capabilities to enhance insights into user behavior and business performance. The pipeline also integrates advanced data science techniques such as sentiment analysis and text categorization to extract valuable insights from unstructured data.

Additionally, the pipeline is deployed on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using EMR (Elastic MapReduce) and S3 for scalability and efficient data processing.

Sentiment Analysis & Text Categorization:
Applies advanced data science techniques to analyze unstructured data, gaining valuable insights into customer reviews and behavior.

Business Data Analysis: 
Aggregates and analyzes business data (such as check-ins and user activity) to identify key trends, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.
Scalable Architecture: Deployed on AWS EMR and S3, which significantly reduces data processing time and enhances scalability.

Results & Impact:
Improved Data Processing Speed: The pipeline processing time was reduced by 3 times, enabling faster data analysis.
Increased Data Accuracy: Achieved a 70% improvement in data accuracy through advanced processing and transformation techniques.

Data-Driven Insights: 
The analysis of Yelp data has enabled deeper insights into user behavior, business performance, and emerging trends.
